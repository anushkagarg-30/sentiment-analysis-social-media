# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis & Social Media Engagement Prediction

This project was completed as part of the Spring 2025 Data Science Bootcamp at NYU Tandon.

## 🔍 Objective
Analyze user-generated content from social media to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and predict engagement (likes) using TF-IDF, metadata, and machine learning models.

## 📁 Key Features
- TF-IDF feature extraction + metadata features
- Models: SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, Stacking
- SMOTE used to address class imbalance
- Likes predicted using Random Forest Regression (R² = 0.997)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Fully annotated notebooks + PPT slides included

## 🛠️ Tools Used
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `XGBoost`, `Seaborn`, `SMOTE`, `Matplotlib`

## 📊 Results
- Best classifier: **SVM with SMOTE** → 82.5% accuracy
- Best regressor: **Random Forest** → RMSE: 0.63, R²: 0.997
- Classification report, accuracy charts, and actual-vs-predicted plots included
